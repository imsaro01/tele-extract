# Telegram Channel File Scrapper

# Overview

This script downloads files from specified Telegram channels using the Telegram API. It supports downloading files with specific extensions and handles both single and multiple channels. The script also includes robust logging and maintains a summary of downloaded files in JSON format.

# Features

- **Download Files**: Automatically downloads files with specified extensions (`.zip`, `.7z`, `.txt`, `.rar`) from Telegram channels.
- **Handle Multiple Channels**: Supports downloading from one or more channels.
- **Rate Limiting**: Implements rate limiting to handle Telegram's API constraints.
- **Logging**: Logs actions and errors to both the console and a log file.
- **Summary**: Maintains a JSON summary of downloaded files and their types.
- **Configuration**: Easily configurable via a `config.ini` file.

# Requirements

- Python 3.7 or higher
- `telethon` library
- Your Telegram API credentials

# Installation

1. **Clone the repository** (if applicable) or download the script.

2. **Install Dependencies**:
   Ensure you have `telethon` installed. You can install it using pip:

   ```bash
   pip install telethon
   ```

3. **Configuration**:
   Create a `config.ini` file in the same directory as the script with the following structure:

   ```ini
   [Telegram]
   API_ID = your_api_id
   API_HASH = your_api_hash
   PHONE_NUMBER = your_phone_number
   CHANNEL_USERNAME = channelname  # Comma-separated list of channel username
   FILE_EXTENSIONS = .zip,.7z,.txt,.rar  # Comma-separated list of file extensions to download
   ```

   Replace `your_api_id`, `your_api_hash`, and `your_phone_number` with your Telegram API credentials and phone number.

4. **Create Required Directories**:
   The script will create the necessary directories (`logs` for logs and `summaries` for the summary file) automatically.

# Usage

Run the script using Python:

```bash
python your_script_name.py
```

Replace `your_script_name.py` with the name of your script file.

# File Structure

- `your_script_name.py`: The main script file.
- `config.ini`: Configuration file with your Telegram API credentials and channel details.
- `logs/`: Directory where log files are stored.
- `summaries/`: Directory where the summary JSON file is stored.

# Log Files

Logs are written to `logs/app.log`. This includes information about the downloading process and any errors encountered.

# Summary File

The summary of downloaded files is stored in `summaries/summary.json`. This file includes counts of files downloaded, categorized by file extension.

# Error Handling

- **Rate Limiting**: The script automatically handles rate limits imposed by Telegram by pausing execution when necessary.
- **Two-Factor Authentication**: If two-factor authentication (2FA) is enabled on your Telegram account, you will be prompted to enter the code.

# Troubleshooting

- Ensure your `config.ini` file is correctly formatted and contains valid Telegram API credentials.
- Make sure the directories specified in the script can be created and written to.
- If you encounter issues, check `logs/app.log` for detailed error messages.
